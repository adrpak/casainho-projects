#summary Digital bathroom scale which logs weight and data on SD Card
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

On this project I hacked a digital bathroom scale, for write (log) my weight variations over time, on a memory SD Card. I write the information (time + weight) on a comma separated values (CSV) file (weight.csv) so I can build a graph using OpenOffice.

*[http://blip.tv/file/get/Jpcasainho-SDCardBathroomScale20090814198.ogg See this video]* that shows the scale working. Here is a picture of a graph made using the data written on "weight.csv" file:

Firmware source code, schematics sources and pictures of current work can be found on [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/source/browse/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/ SVN].

==Observations and things to improve==
The system works almost perfectly. Although there are some things I would like to improve:

 * Sometimes the system can't read correctly the last weight value from the SD Card, I believe that is a problem from physical connection, I can try to enable and use CRC when reading/writing to the SD Card (writing to SD Card seems to have no problem);

 * The actual LCD don't have back light, I already bought one with it and soon I hope to change it. Back light is important to be able to read data on LCD or I simple can't when I have low light on bathroom;

 * The size of the characters on LCD are very small for this application, since my eyes are far from it when I am weighting myself. Maybe I can find another LCD?

 * Me and my girlfriend, we both need to lost weight, we both use the scale. Luckily our weight values are very different and I can differ them on system and have 2 different files on SD Card to register our weights separately. I would prefer to have some way to identify each person, so more people could use the scale if needed;

 * I need to put all the wires and boards on the down side of the scale and try to make it more robust as possible.

=Technical details=
==The original cheap scale I bought on market== 
I bought the cheapest digital bathroom scale I could found on market, it were 20â‚¬, Fagor model BB-90. Other scales just looks the same, because they have the same number of LCD digits and the system appears to behave in the same way.

==How to get the weight value==
First I thought that I could read the sensors and got an analog voltage relative to weight but I couldn't find a way to do it. Next a friend at work give me the idea to try read the signals that went to original LCD, and it was a simple and easy way to have what I need :-)

The original LCD have 15 pins, 3 backplanes and 12 segments. I did understand how the LCD signals works reading this [http://casainho-projects.googlecode.com/svn-history/r71/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/docs/lcd-an0162.pdf application note].

The segments signals have voltage that can be read directly by the LPC2103. The backplanes signals can't be ready directly by the LPC2103 (I think) and then I made a very simple voltage detector using a LM258 opamp so I get a "trigger" signal every time the backplane signal get near is maximum value. Since all the signals are sequential and have the same period of time, I just look for one backplane signal (just one voltage detector circuit with the LM258 opamp).

The next 2 pictures shows a backplane signal and 2 segments signals.

The next picture shows a backplane signal and a "trigger" signal I got using an LM258 opamp working as a comparator, like a signal value detector.

==Selection of microcontroller==
Arduino/Atmel AVR, or ARM? - I really like Arduino, mainly because it's Open Hardware/Firmware and there is a lot of Open Hardware modules for it. I prefer to use ARM instead of Arduino/AVR because I have the same Free Software tools PLUS cheap, Open JTAG debugger! I don't really like the fact that Atmel have a closed, proprietary, debugger.

I am being using ARM7 LPC2103 which is the cheaper on this times and have all the functionalities and working power that I need. I decided to use Olimex dev. board [http://www.olimex.com/dev/lpc-h2103.html LPC-H2103].

==LCD module added==
I needed to use another LCD since I couldn't maintain the original one. I decided to try the cheap ones based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD44780_Character_LCD HD44780], since I have experience with them and I got some with me. Luckily, this LCD just enters perfect in the place of the original :-)

On the next picture we can see the LCD module and also the connections I made to original PCB using flat cable, on the pads that connected to original LCD.
