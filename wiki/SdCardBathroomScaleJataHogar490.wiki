#summary About the bathroom scale Jata Hogar 490

= Introduction =

I bought another bathroom scale. The model is "Jata Hogar 490", looks like it is from a [http://www.jata.es/ Spanish company].

= Status =

Working correctly on 2009.10.05. Code is on [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/source/browse/ SVN].

= Some pictures from original scale =

= Technical explanation of the hack =
I will just document the differences from the other [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/wiki/SdCardBathroomScale first bathroom scale I did hack], all the rest is equal. 

I am using the ADC on LPC2103 for be able to read and sync with the LCD signals. Since the LPC2103 don't have 13 ADC channels, I used an external analog multiplexer of 16 channels, the 74HC4067 IC.

There is 13 pins that connects on the original LCD. There is 4 backplanes signals, which are the pins 10, 11, 12 and 13. Each other pins holds 4 bits.

Pin 1 holds bit data for kg and lb symbols. Pin 2 and 3 holds bit data for most significant digit of weight value. Pin 8 and 9 holds bit data for least significant (decimal) digit of weight value.

= Oscilloscope images from the pins that connects to original LCD =

Each one of the following 13 images, shows the signal at each pin, when the scale starts and shows 0.0 kg on LCD. First image shows the signal at line 1 and last image shows the signal at line 13.

The blue line is a signal I used to trigger the oscilloscope. I got that trigger signal as a reference for the first backplane signal (line 10).

Here is the sequence of bits on pin signals and the correspondence to the segments on the LCD:
{{{
Pin 1 of 2: degf
Pin 2 of 2: xcba

             a
           f   b
             g
           e   c
             d   x

Examples:
                  degfxcba
Number 0: 11010111
Number 9: 10110111
Number 6: 11110101
Number 2: 11100011
Number 1: 00000110
}}}

1st line: 4th bit is on - this is the bit that turns on the "kg" segment.

2nd line: 1st, 2nd and 3rd bits are on, for the "cba" segments of "0" number. 4th bit would be the "." bit that is never turned on.

3rd line: here just the "g" segment is turned off from the "degf" segments of "0" number.
