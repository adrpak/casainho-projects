NOTE: This is the original README written by Sam Wong. I made some changes
to the code to fit my system (and did clean what I didn't need).

I use a CNC machine and a plastic extruder. I did build the plastic extruder
"ThermoplastExtruder 2.0" from RepRap project.

I am using a Nema 17 stepper motor + a heater. The Arduino firmwware must
manage the heater temperature and motor speed. EMC2 custom scripts communicates
with extruder by serial port and send commands to read and set the temperature
of the heater and the same for motor speed.

NAME
    README - Scripts and instructions for running EMC2 based RepStrap

DESCRIPTION
    This package helps you to build a Linux EMC2 based RepStrap machine (Non
    standard RepRap machine, useful for bootstrapping a RepRap).

    If you have a desktop milling machine controlled by EMC2 or Mach3
    already, with some hardware modification, specifically adding the
    plastic extruder print head, it would be mechanical capable in printing
    3D plastic model. This package serves as a guide to your integration.

    The package comes with two big components:

    1.  An Amtel AVR firmware, to be compiled with Arduino
        (<http://www.arduino.cc>), which is designed for the following
        hardware combinations:

        *   the RepRap's Extruder Controller 2.2
            (<http://reprap.org/bin/view/MainExtruder_Controller_2_2>)

        *   DC Motor and Magnetic Rotary Encoder
            (<http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/Magnetic_Rotary_Encoder_1_0>)
            as extrusion driver, with software PID loop implemented.

        *   Thermocouple or Thermistor for temperature reading

        *   Resistive heating element driven by MOSFET

        The program architecture is also flexible enough to extend the
        support to stepper motor (Patch is welcome!), as well as a different
        motherboard design.

    2.  EMC2 Integration. A set of scripts allows communication to happen
        between the EMC2 and the firmware mentioned above. As long as the
        communication protcol is compatible, this set of scripts are still
        useful even if it's not the same firmware. The protocol is developed
        based on the RepRap 3rd Gen Electronics internal communication
        protocol.

        A few more scripts included for adopting Skeinforge GCode output.
        Skeinforge is one of the primary tool to generate RepRap usable
        GCode from STL and other 3D format.

            A HAL script to be included in the EMC2 setup.

        "repstrap-extruder.py"
            A user space driver to control and communicate with the RepStrap
            extruder controller.

        "repstrap-extruder.pyvcp"
            A PYVCP gadget for EMC2's AXIS UI allowing control of the
            extruder and reporting its status.

        "skeinforge2emc.pl"
            A filter program to convert Skeinforge GCode output to a more
            EMC2 friendly input.

        "softlink-mcode-inject.sh"
            simple shell script to create necessary soft-link to accept M1xx
            M-Code.

    "/README"
        The documents of the scripts and everything.

SETUP GUIDE
  Firmware
    A firmware should comes with the package. Now config your hardware in
    the "Hardware.h", then compile and burn the firmware with Arduino
    (<http://www.arduino.cc/>).

        TODO: Documentation for this section is to be completed

  EMC2 Setup
    1.  Put all these scripts and files in one folder, say, your home
        folder. The location is assume to be "/script/folder" in the
        following document.

        Make sure all the scripts are excutable:

            chmod a+x *.pl *.py *.sh

    2.  Edit your EMC2's machine ini (usually in
        "~/emc2/config/your-machine/your-machine.ini") to include the
        following lines:

            [AXIS]
            ...    
            PROGRAM_PREFIX = /script/folder
            PYVCP = /script/folder/repstrap-extruder.pyvcp
    
            [FILTER]
            PROGRAM_EXTENSION = .skf Skeinforge Output
            skf = /script/folder/skeinforge2emc.pl

        There should also be a "POSTGUI_HALFILE" in the "[HAL]" section. If
        not, create one:

            [HAL]
            ...
            POSTGUI_HALFILE = custom_postgui.hal

    3.  Now include the HAL file by editing "custom_postgui.hal", or create
        one if it does not exist, and put the following lines into it:

            source /script/folder/repstrap-extruder.hal

    4.  Edit the "repstrap-extruder.hal" file.

        Modify the path that points to "repstrap-extruder.pyvcp" as you see
        fit. We will come back and modify "steps_per_mm_cube" later.

    5.  Edit the "repstrap-commtest.py" and "repstrap-extruder.py". Make any
        correction to the "COMM_PORT" and "COMM_BAUDRATE" so to reflect your
        machine setup. Specifically, the device of your serial port which is
        hooked to the Extruder Controller.

        Usually, the "COMM_BAUDRATE" value needs not to be modified.

        Then invoke the "repstrap-commtest.py" in your consle to see if the
        communication works. It should print something like this:

            Sleeping for 5 seconds for the serial port and firmware to settle...
            Flushing communicaton channel...
            Querying for Heater 1 temperature (Command 91)...
            Reading back the response...
            Readback result code (1 for success, anything else - failure): 1
            The current temperature is: 19

    6.  Execute "softlink-mcode-inject.sh" to have the softlinks needed
        created.

    7.  Fire up the EMC. Now hopefully you can see a green icon for the
        Connection LED.

        Play around with the Heater and Motor setup. The motor >> button
        should push the filament into the extruder. If the direction is
        wrong, you have to correct it in the firmware.

        For PID controlled DC Motor, you might also experiement with the PID
        settings and put it back to the firmware when you are done.

    8.  Now calibrate the "steps_per_mm_cube" settings. The value is used
        for commanding the motor speed in response to the flowrate needed.

        You need to know how many steps there are when spinning your
        extruder motor axis for one cycle. This should be a number related
        to the encoder count, or stepper number of steps and gear ratio. You
        should also know how many teeth are there on your axis. Last but not
        least, please have the thickness of your filament ready. (Measure
        it! it usually have variation of ~0.1mm)

        Now feed a filament into the gear, use position control mode to feed
        the filament for a cycle or two. Please note that you should either
        heat up the extruder and be ready to melt the plastic, or don't push
        too far into it or you might break your setup.

        Reverse feed the filament and pull that out, and by measuring the
        teeth mark on the filament, figure out the length of filament fed
        for spinning the motor for one cycle.

        Open "repstrap-extruder.hal" and feed all these parameters into the
        equation and you will get the "steps_per_mm_cube" value you needed.

    9.  To have the new configuration loaded, you must restart the EMC2
        Axis.

  Skienforge Configuration
    Besides the normal configuration that you must go through, like "Carve"
    and "Speed", you must also configure the following

    1.  In the "Export Preferences", turn off "Delete Comments". Set "File
        Extension" to be "skf".

    2.  In the "Speed Preferences", turn on "Add Flow Rate". The "Flow Rate
        Setting" is calculated as:

            Flow Rate Setting = Math.PI * (Extrusion Diameter over Thickness * Carve's Layer Thickness)^2 / 4 * Feedrate

  Try that out!
    Now you should be able to print something.

    1.  Carve a STL file by Skienforge.

    2.  Fire up EMC2's AXIS, open the "SKF" result file.

    3.  Set zero for your print head. And Hit Run!

TODO
    *   Leverage EMC2 ability to control the motor. Maybe we need a faster
        communication channel first. AVR USB?

    *   Coordinate the extrusion speed with axis acceleration and speed.
